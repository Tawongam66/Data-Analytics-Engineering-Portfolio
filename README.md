# 📊 Data Analytics Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio repo! This space documents my journey through the data engineering roadmap, with hands-on projects, experiments, and notes across key technologies and workflows.

## 🚀 Purpose

To build a structured, transparent learning archive that showcases my skills in:
- Python programming
- SQL and data querying
- ETL pipeline development
- Docker and containerization
- Workflow automation
- Jupyter notebooks and data storytelling
